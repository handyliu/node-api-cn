The `stream.PassThrough` class is a trivial implementation of a [Transform][]
stream that simply passes the input bytes across to the output. Its purpose is
primarily for examples and testing, but there are some use cases where
`stream.PassThrough` is useful as a building block for novel sorts of streams.

`stream.PassThrough`类是一个极简[Transform][]流，只是把输入字节原样不动直接输出。
一开始的目的是用来做例子和测试，但是有时也作为某些新颖的流的基本组成部分起作用。
